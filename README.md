# 212project.github.io

Welcome to our Repo for our Final Project for CSC 212 at URI!

Within this repo we have added many files, including our .cpp files .txt files and .jpeg files



Instructions for compiling and running code:

1. Download the source files (SierpinskiTriangle.cpp and VonKoch'sSnowflake.cpp)

2. Compile the code, for example for VonKoch'sSnowflake.cpp (in terminal) 'g++ VonKoch'sSnowflake.cpp -o snow'

3. Run the code, for example './snow'

4. (Depending on the program) The program will then ask for the level of complexity for the drawing (enter numbers 1-5 (or whatever the program prompts user for), 1 being simple 5 being complex

5. The program will then print "Process is complete" 

6. The program made a new file eg. snowflake5.txt or triangle4.txt within the same directory as the source code

7. Copy all the contents from that text file

8. You can either test this code locally or through the use of our website (https://andrewcampbell15.github.io/212project.github.io/)

9. If you choose to test locally you will need to download 'l-system-plotter.py' from our repo and run this code 'python3 l-system-plotter.py YOUR_SNOWFLAKE/TRIANGLE_TXT_FILE_NAME.txt <output file name> 60'

10. If you test using the website simply paste the txt file documents where it says 'instructions' and then hit the run button
  
11. Enjoy your shape!
